                <p> My name is Nneka. It's pronounced like <strong> in · nay · ka</strong>. It's Nigerian in origin and means of a famous or prominent mother. I was born and raised in Arkansas. I love it here very much. I come from a very large family where I'm the 2nd of 14 children. </p>

            <section id="about-school"><!-- about school-->
                   <p> Currently, I'm in my senior year at UALR. I've always had a love for drawing and computers so a Bachelor's degree in Web Design and Development seemed like the perfect fit. It's a fun field but I quickly realized that it requires a lot of work and attention to detail.  </p>

            <section id="about-projects"><!-- about this project-->
                 <p> This site is my final for RHET 4307: Writing Software Documentation. Throughout this semester (Spring 2020), Chrome Canvas has been the software that I used for this class. Even though it's not a complex software, you can still have a lot of fun with it. </p>
